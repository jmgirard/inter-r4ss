We conclude the workshop with a discussion of intermediate statistical modeling techniques in R. We will be able to use the same R formulas and {easystats} functions taught in the introductory workshop to extend the linear model to the generalized linear model (allowing us to model non-normal outcome variables) and linear mixed-effects/multilevel models (allowing us to model data with a clustered or hierarchical structure). We will also touch briefly upon the combination of both techniques (i.e., generalized linear mixed-effects/multilevel models).
