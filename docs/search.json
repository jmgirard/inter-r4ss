    "text": "A three-day workshop spanning data wrangling, data visualization, and modeling in R. Developed by Jeffrey Girard for the Pittsburgh Summer Methodology Series (June 5−7, 2023).\nR is a popular software option for wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing data in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. It is completely free, runs on all major platforms (i.e., Windows, Mac, and Linux), offers a rich catalog of methodological tools, and has a large community that supports users at all skill levels.\nThis workshop emphasizes data wrangling (e.g., transforming, reshaping, and merging data) and communication skills (e.g., visualizing data/models and authoring reports) in addition to data analysis skills as the former are critical but often underappreciated.\nThe workshop assumes that attendees have basic knowledge of the R programming language (e.g., how to create objects in the R environment, work with vectors and functions, and import data files as tibbles/data frames). This knowledge is provided by the Introduction to R for Social Scientists workshop for those who need it.\nThis workshop will also discuss how to implement popular extensions to linear modeling, such as GLM (generalized linear modeling, e.g., logistic and poisson regression) and MLM (multilevel modeling, e.g., random intercepts and slopes regression) in R. This part of the workshop could be a nice preview to these techniques for attendees unfamiliar with them but is meant more for those already familiar with their underlying theory (perhaps having learned about them in other software)."

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy enroll in this workshop?\nWhile there are many great educational resources for learning R, including some free video courses and textbooks, this workshop will provide a structured, guided, and communal environment that is tailor-built for researchers in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Thus, it emphasizes the concepts and skills most needed by such researchers. In particular, it teaches modern data science techniques using tools from the tidyverse ecosystem (e.g., the dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 packages) and statistical techniques using tools from the easystats ecosystem (e.g., the parameters, performance, modelbased, and see packages). The beauty of these tools is that they are both beginner-friendly and scalable to solve more complex problems and interface with more advanced techniques.\n\n\nWill this workshop cover SEM or longitudinal MLM?\nThis workshop will cover how to implement GLM and MLM in R (including simple longitudinal models). However, it will not cover the theory underlying either technique and will not cover structural equation modeling (SEM) at all. For those interested in learning more about the theory of MLM, more advanced longitudinal models, and SEM, please see the Courses page for more workshop options!\n\n\nWhat aspects of Quarto will this workshop cover?\nQuarto is a scientific and technical authoring system that integrates with R and RStudio. It can be used to create reports, blogs, websites, articles, books, slideshows, and posters that seamlessly integrate R code and output with formatted text. This workshop will cover the basics of using Quarto to create scientific reports. More advanced uses of Quarto will be mentioned but not taught."
